    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>

    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/gardening/g2437/english-gardens/">English estate gardens.</a></p>
    
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
